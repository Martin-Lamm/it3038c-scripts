Recently this past week I purchased my first car, so I had the idea of making a script that helps someone whos on the market to buy a car.

Obvicouly there are a million different ways to buy a car, but this is probably the easiest way to select one if you just wanna be fast.



The script doesn't need any special pluggins, all you really need is to download the PY file and run it in any environment.  In my case I used PYCharm.
Download the Script
Open your environment(Visual Studio, Pycharm, etc)
Run the script
Follow the following prompts on the command line!
